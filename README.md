<b>Are you a server with toxic management? :D ok it was a joke, but sometimes we need to have fun... Right? ü§°</b>

# **NOTE**: "Don't use the plugin from the source right now, as this version is still in development and restructuring!"

## Installation & Basic Usage - ‚ùî
* You can download the plugin as .phar from [releases](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/TrollXD/releases) and install it directly. You can also download it as a folder with the [download](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/TrollXD/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) option. Either way, all you have to do is put it in "root/plugins"
<!--
* If you want to add your language: (both options)
  * Open the "..../plugins/TrollXD/resources/langs" & "..../plugin_data/TrollXD/langs" folder and create the language file you want to add (e.g. "de.json") and then you can add your own language based on an existing one!
	You can also open a ["pull request"](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/TrollXD/pulls) if you want to contribute and share your language with other users! <br>
    Also remember to change the "language" parameter in "config.yml" to the filename of the new language. And add the new language to the "languages" parameter. -->
